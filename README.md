## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

Minion is built using **Flutter** and modern packages to ensure performance, responsiveness, and full localization support:

- **Flutter & Dart** – Core framework and language
- **Material Design 3** – Modern UI components
- **Google Fonts** – English typography
- **IranYekan** – Farsi font support
- **Localization** – `flutter_localizations`, `intl`, and `flutter_i18n` for multi-language support
- **Asset Management** – `flutter_gen` for automatic assets handling
- **Icons** – `CupertinoIcons` for iOS-style icons

## 📌 Notes

- The app supports **English and Farsi**. Language can be switched dynamically via the in-app language toggle.
- **Dark and light themes** are fully integrated and can be toggled from the app bar.
- Make sure your Flutter SDK is version **>=3.8.1** as specified in `pubspec.yaml`.
- All images and fonts must be present in the `assets/` folder; otherwise, the app may crash.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add form validation for `PersonalInformationForm`.
- Load skills dynamically from a backend or JSON file.
- Allow users to change their profile picture.
- Enhance skill card animations for better interactivity.
- Integrate **state management** (Provider/Riverpod) for larger projects.
